# ADR-0004: Atomic Deck-Item Mutation Result Contract

## Status

Accepted — the `{ id, patch }` result-shape contract this ADR establishes is
still current, but issue #219 (the item-model refactor) renamed every method
and type in it and removed the collection/group inputs. See the **Amendment
(2026-08-18, issue #219)** section before Consequences.

## Context

ADR-0003 established that deck-item creation with a first slide and an
optional theme runs as one SQLite transaction (`createDeckItemWithTheme`,
now `createDeckItemWithFirstSlide`) and that only persisted theme IDs may
enter repository creation. It did not fully close two things (issue #102):

- The repository/IPC operation returned a bare `SnapshotPatch`. The renderer
  identified the newly created owner by diffing entity id arrays before and
  after the mutation (`findCreatedId`). Against an empty "previous ids" set
  (the pattern used by the create-item dialog) this is fragile: any array
  ordering assumption or an unrelated concurrent upsert in the same patch
  could select the wrong id, and the pattern actively invites future bugs.
- Two creation paths still ran the pre-#102 create-owner-then-create-slide
  sequence instead of the atomic operation: legacy app-menu creation
  (`navigation-context.tsx::createPresentation` / `createEmptyLyric`) and
  library/group creation (`use-library-panel-management.ts`'s
  `createPresentationInGroup` / `createLyricInGroup` / `createTalkInGroup`,
  which additionally ran a *third* IPC call to add the item to its group).

## Decision

- The IPC result for atomic deck-item creation is
  `DeckItemCreateResult = { itemId: Id; patch: SnapshotPatch }` (declared in
  `app/core/ipc.ts`). The renderer applies `patch` via `mutatePatch` and
  selects/navigates using `itemId` directly — it never infers the created id
  from patch contents.
- `CastRepository.createDeckItemWithFirstSlide(input)` is the operation
  backing the IPC channel `cast:createDeckItemWithTheme`. It contains the
  validation, transaction, and materialization logic described in ADR-0003
  and returns `{ itemId, patch }`.
- `CastRepository.createDeckItemWithTheme(input)` is preserved as a thin
  wrapper (`return this.createDeckItemWithFirstSlide(input).patch;`) purely
  for existing direct-repository callers/tests that predate this ADR and
  expect a raw `SnapshotPatch`. New callers use
  `createDeckItemWithFirstSlide`. The IPC handler in `app/main/ipc.ts` calls
  `createDeckItemWithFirstSlide`, not the wrapper.
- Legacy app-menu creation and library/group creation now call the same
  `createDeckItemWithTheme` IPC operation as the create-item dialog, with
  explicit `collectionId: null` and `themeId: null`, and (for group creation)
  the target `groupId` passed directly so the playlist-entry insert happens
  inside the same transaction. The prior create-then-create-slide(-then-add-
  to-group) sequences are removed; there is exactly one code path that
  creates a deck item's owner and first slide together.
- `createSlide` is unchanged and remains the only operation for adding a
  *later* slide to an existing owner.
- The same contract governs whole-deck duplication (issue #103):
  `DeckItemDuplicateResult = { itemId: Id; patch: SnapshotPatch }`, declared
  alongside `DeckItemCreateResult` in `app/core/ipc.ts`. `duplicateDeckItem`
  returns it, and `deck-bin-panel.tsx` selects the returned `itemId` instead
  of scanning `[...presentations, ...lyrics, ...talks]` for the new entry.
  Any future repository operation that creates an addressable entity and
  returns a patch follows this shape rather than inventing a third one.
- Repository operations that reject an input on domain grounds raise a typed
  error carrying a `code` (`DeckItemDuplicationError` with
  `code: 'unsupported-owner-type'` for Talk input, mirroring the existing
  `CollectionDeletionError`), thrown before any write.

## Amendment (2026-08-18, issue #219 item-model refactor)

The unified deck-item concept and collections/libraries were destroyed. The
`{ itemId, patch }` result shape this ADR establishes is unchanged; the names
around it are not:

- `DeckItemCreateResult`/`DeckItemDuplicateResult` → `ItemCreateResult`/
  `ItemDuplicateResult` (still `{ itemId: Id; patch: SnapshotPatch }`).
- `createDeckItemWithFirstSlide`/`createDeckItemWithTheme` → `createItem`.
  There is now exactly one method (no thin-wrapper pair): `createItem(input:
  ItemCreateInput)` returns `{ itemId, patch }` directly, since collections
  died along with the pre-#102 code paths this ADR was retiring, and no
  caller needing a bare `SnapshotPatch` remained to justify keeping a second
  entry point. `ItemCreateInput` carries no `collectionId`/`groupId` — a
  playlist attachment is expressed as `playlistId`/`position` alone.
- `duplicateDeckItem` → `duplicateItem`, taking `ItemDuplicateInput = { type:
  'presentation' | 'lyric'; id }` (typed, not a bare id) so the decoder
  rejects `'talk'` explicitly at the trust boundary.
- **`DeckItemDuplicationError` no longer exists**, and neither does
  `CollectionDeletionError`. Talk's "unsupported owner type" rejection for
  duplication is no longer a thrown, `code`-carrying error raised by the
  repository — it is structural: `ItemDuplicateInput`'s wire type only
  admits `'presentation' | 'lyric'`, so a `'talk'` input is rejected by the
  codec before any repository method runs. Any future repository-level
  error taxonomy should not assume this error class still exists.
- Playlist-panel item creation lost its extra "add to group" IPC call along
  with the group concept: `use-playlist-panel-management.ts` (renamed from
  `use-library-panel-management.ts`) passes `playlistId`/`position` on the
  same `createItem` call instead of a follow-up mutation.

## Consequences

- Every successful UI-driven item creation now performs exactly one IPC
  call and one `mutatePatch`/snapshot mutation, whether triggered from the
  create dialog, the app menu, or a playlist's "add new item" action.
- Renderer code can no longer accidentally select the wrong id after
  creation: there is no `findCreatedId`/set-difference call left on any
  deck-item creation path.
- `CastRepository` intentionally exposed two methods for the same
  transaction (`createDeckItemWithFirstSlide` returning `{ itemId, patch }`,
  and `createDeckItemWithTheme` returning `patch` alone) so that pre-existing
  repository-level tests did not need to change their assertions on this
  change.
  **Superseded (issue #219).** The two-method pair is gone: there is one
  `createItem(input)` returning `{ itemId, patch }`. The wrapper existed only
  to spare pre-existing tests a rewrite; the item-model refactor rewrote the
  whole persistence layer's tests anyway, so the wrapper's reason to exist
  went with it.
- `tests/app/renderer/contexts/asset-editor/theme-resolution.test.tsx` (owned by
  issue #101) mocked `window.castApi.createDeckItemWithTheme` to resolve with
  a raw `SnapshotPatch`. Those mocks predated this ADR's IPC result contract
  and have been updated to resolve `{ itemId, patch }`; the mocked method name
  is now `createItem` (issue #219).
- No deck-item mutation path infers an id from patch contents any more:
  `findCreatedId` is gone from creation, and the snapshot scan is gone from
  duplication. Reviewers should treat a reintroduced set-difference over
  entity id arrays as a regression against this ADR.
